(41, 41, '<h2><b>Ischial spine</b></h2><br> When performing a transvaginal pudendal nerve block, the ischial spine is palpated through the wall of the vagina and the needle is then passed through the vaginal mucous membrane toward the ischial spine. Eventually, the needle pierces the sacrospinous ligament, at which point the pudendal nerve is bathed with anesthetic. Remember--the pudendal nerve is within the pudendal canal, and it wraps around the ischial spine before it delivers its branches. So, administering the nerve block at the ischial spine allows a physician to anesthetize all the branches of the pudendal nerve. <br><br>This is a very important landmark that you want to remember! Also remember--the pudendal nerve block does not need to be administered transvaginally. In a perineal pudendal nerve block, the ischial tuberosity is palpated through the buttock and the needle is inserted into the pudendal canal about one inch deep medial to the ischial tuberosity. The anesthetic can then be injected to bathe pudendal nerve. In this case, a different anatomical landmark, the ischial tuberosity, is used to deliver the nerve block.<br><br> Arcus tendineus levator ani is the origin for levator ani. It is a specialization of the fascia of obturator internus which runs from the spine of the ischium to the superior pubic ramus. The coccyx is the most inferior portion of the vertebral column--it is found on the posterior wall of the pelvis. The lateral fornix of the vagina is the space found lateral to the cervix as it protrudes into the vagina. <br><br>The obturator foramen is a large foramen on the anterior side of the pelvis, formed by the pubic and ischial rami. It is a site of attachment for obturator externus and internus. None of these structures are appropriate landmarks to use when performing a pudendal nerve block. ', ' '),
(42, 42, '<h2><b>Pelvic splanchnics</b></h2><br> Erection is mediated by parasympathetic nerves, and the pelvic splanchnic nerves are the parasympathetic nerves that innervate the smooth muscle and glands of all pelvic viscera. So, the pelvic splanchnic nerves are the nerves contributing the fibers to the prostatic plexus which innervate penile/clitoral erectile tissue to cause erection. None of the other listed nerves carry parasympathetic fibers which could innervate the penis and cause erection. Additionally, none of these other nerves contribute to the prostatic plexus, which is an extension of the inferior hypogastric plexus. The deep perineal nerve is the a branch of the perineal nerve that innervates all the muscles of the urogenital triangle. <br><br>The dorsal nerve of the penis/clitoris is a branch of the pudendal nerve that provides sensory innervation to the skin of the shaft of the penis/clitoris. The genitofemoral nerve provides motor innervation to the cremaster muscle and sensory innervation to the skin of the anterior scrotum/labium majus and the upper medial thigh. Finally, the pudendal nerve is the major nerve of the perineal region. Its branches include the inferior rectal nerve, perineal nerve, and the dorsal nerve of the penis/clitoris. ', ' '),
(43, 43, '<h2><b>Pelvic Splanchnic Nerves</b></h2><br>  Pelvic splanchnic nerves carry parasympathetic fibers from the lateral horn of the spinal cord at the S2, 3, and 4 levels. They can be seen coming off of the ventral primary rami of S2, 3, and 4 and going to the inferior hypogastric plexus. <br><br>These nerves provide parasympathetic innervation to the pelvic viscera and the GI tract distal to the left colic flexure. (Remember, the vagus gives parasympathetic innervation to the rest of the gut.) Sacral splanchnic nerves come off the sacral sympathetic chain ganglia, carrying sympathetic fibers that will go to the inferior hypogastric plexus. <br><br>To remember the difference between the pelvic and sacral splanchnics, just remember that the sacral splanchnics are named after a spinal cord segment, just like the thoracic, lumbar, and cervical splanchnics that you know and love. These all carry sympathetic fibers. Pelvic splanchnics are not named after a spinal cord segment and they\'re different; they carry parasympathetic fibers. The grey rami communicantes are structures that postganglionic sympathetic neurons travel on to get out of the sympathetic trunk and rejoin a spinal nerve. <br><br>There are gray rami in the pelvis. The white rami communicantes are structures that preganglionic sympathetic fibers use to get out of a spinal nerve to enter the sympathetic trunk. White rami are seen between the T1 to L2 levels, but not in the pelvis. Finally, the hypogastric nerves carry postganglionic sympathetic nerves from the superior hypogastric plexus to the inferior hypogastric plexus.', ' '),
(44, 44, '<h2><b>Preganglionic parasympathetics--inferior hypogastric</b></h2><br> Although all the other splanchnic nerves carry sympathetic fibers, the pelvic splanchnic nerves transmit preganglionic parasympathetic fibers from S2, 3, and 4. These fibers are carried to the inferior hypogastric plexus. The parasympathetic fibers from the inferior hypogastric plexus supply the smooth muscle of the pelvic viscera, while the sympathetic fibers from the inferior hypogastric plexus supply vascular smooth muscle of vessels supplying the pelvic viscera. The superior hypogastric plexus is a continuation of the intermesenteric plexus--it contributes sympathetic fibers to the inferior hypogastric plexus through hypogastric nerves.', ' '),
(45, 45, '<h2><b>Pia mater</b></h2><br> The pia mater is the third, deepest layer of the cranial meninges. It is a delicate investment that is closely adhered to the brain, and enmeshes blood vessels on the surface of the CNS. The arachnoid mater is the middle layer of the meninges. It is a filmy and transparent layer that is adhered to the dura mater and connected to the pia mater via trabeculae. The dura mater is the tough, outer layer of the meninges. It is composed of two adhered layers in the skull (recall it is one layer associated with the spinal cord): the periosteal layer, which lines the cranial cavity, and the meningeal layer, which is adjacent to the arachnoid mater. In some areas, there are elongations of the meningeal layer of dura mater, which act as partitions to create compartments within the cranial cavity. Two of the largest dural partitions are the falx cerebri and tentorium cerebelli. ', ' '),

It is made of the greater wings of the sphenoid and squamous part of the temporal bones laterally and the petrous part of the temporal bones posteriorly. See Netter Plate 6 and 7 for a better picture of this. Several cranial nerves enter foramina in the middle cranial fossa; all of these nerves might have been damaged in the fall. <br><br>The trigeminal nerve (CN V) has three divisions that all leave through spaces in the middle cranial fossa.

So, all of these nerves might have been damaged in the fall.

Now, you need to think about which nerve might be damaged by an aneurysm of the superior cerebellar artery. The oculomotor nerve, which innervates the superior rectus, medial rectus, inferior rectus, and inferior oblique muscles, passes between the posterior cerebral artery and the superior cerebellar artery. It could be injured if there was enlargement of or damage to either of these vessels. None of the other cranial nerves are in the right position to be injured from an aneurysm of the superior cerebellar artery. ', ' '),
